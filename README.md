# iOS OOP & POP Programming Exercises

This repository contains Swift playground exercises demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Protocol-Oriented Programming (POP) concepts.

### Exercise 1: Social Media Post Class

- ✅ Demonstrates basic class creation with properties and methods
- ✅ Implements a Post class with author, content, and likes properties
- ✅ Includes a display() method to format post information

### Exercise 2: Shopping Cart Singleton

- ✅ Implements the Singleton design pattern with a ShoppingCartSingleton class
- ✅ Uses composition for managing Product objects
- ✅ Includes discount strategies with the Strategy pattern
- ✅ Demonstrates cart management functionality

### Exercise 3: Payment Processor Protocol

- ✅ Uses protocol-oriented programming with the PaymentProcessor protocol
- ✅ Implements error handling with custom PaymentError types
- ✅ Creates concrete implementations (CreditCardProcessor, CashProcessor)
- ✅ Demonstrates try-catch error handling for payment processing

iOS OOP & POP Programming Exercises

This repository contains Swift playground exercises demonstrating Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and Protocol-Oriented Programming (POP) concepts for my iOS development bootcamp.

### Exercise 1: Social Media Post Class

- ✅ Demonstrates basic class creation with properties and methods
- ✅ Implements a Post class with author, content, and likes properties
- ✅ Includes a display() method to format post information

### Exercise 2: Shopping Cart Singleton

- ✅ Implements the Singleton design pattern with a ShoppingCartSingleton class
- ✅ Uses composition for managing Product objects
- ✅ Implements discount strategies with the Strategy pattern
- ✅ Features cart management functionality (add/remove products, clear cart)
- ✅ Calculates pricing with configurable discount strategies

### Exercise 3: Payment Processor Protocol

- ✅ Uses protocol-oriented programming with the PaymentProcessor protocol
- ✅ Implements error handling with custom PaymentError types
- ✅ Creates concrete implementations (CreditCardProcessor, CashProcessor)
- ✅ Demonstrates try-catch error handling for various payment scenarios

### Implementation Notes

- Code is designed for Swift Playgrounds environment
- Exercise 2 incorporates the nonisolated(unsafe) modifier for Xcode 16 compatibility
- All exercise requirements are implemented with proper Swift syntax and conventions
- Error handling is implemented using Swift's do-try-catch mechanism
